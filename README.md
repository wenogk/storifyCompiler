# Storify
Application that simplifies the process of building choose-your-own-path experiences. Was inspired by the Netflix movie, "Bandersnatch"

### How it works
Stories are written in my own syntax, which is very easy to learn and requires no coding experience from the user. This story in my syntax is then compiled to a JSON object and can then the story can be viewed.

### Features
  * Write stories
  * Unlimited options at each path
  * Video integration support with Youtube for video experiences
  * Reference to any path arbitrarily using its id
  * Choose-your-own-path story viewer with youtubePlayer support

### Syntax tutorial
The syntax is line based, therefore each line is treated as a separate item except for when it is normal text where you can type for as long as you want.

### Future improvements
To build a visual editor, need to use library such as https://jsplumbtoolkit.com/
